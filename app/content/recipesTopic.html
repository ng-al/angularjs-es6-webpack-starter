    <h1>Module Recipes (Factory Methods)</h1>

    <p>
        In this app we are using the inline injector form to register all of the different parts of an Angular application.
        The form of an inline injector is <code>["inject1", "inject2", ..., constructorFn]</code> where the constructor
        function has a corresponding parameter for each injected resource.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to use an ECMAScript class constructor as an Angular component, we <em>could</em> use the following verbose form:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>
            class MyAngularComponent { <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;static get name() { return "myAngularComponent"; } <br /><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constructor(inject1, inject2) { <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br /><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;static factory(inject1, inject2) { return new MyAngularComponent(inject1, inject2); } <br />
            } <br /><br />
            MyAngularComponent.$inject = ["inject1", "inject2", MyAngularComponent.factory];
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>
        This pattern works for all recipe types.  Assume that the preceding class represents a factory service.
        Then to register the "service" with a module:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>
            angular.module("myModule").factory(MyAngularComponent.name, MyAngularComponent.$inject);
        </code>
    </p>
    <h3>Simplification</h3>
    <p>
        One problem with this pattern, is that the parameter list for the recipe is in three places: the constructor function,
        the factory function, and the injection array. This starter app uses a technique where the parameter list need only be specified once.
    </p>
    <h4>ng-annotate-loader</h4>
    <p>
        We are using a webpack loader that will automatically build the $inject static property on a class that is <em>annotated.</em>
        To annotate a constructor for injection, precede the constructor with a special comment:  <strong>/*@ngInject*/</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Normally, if a constructor function has a <strong>$inject</strong> property, then Angular can construct the object directly from the constructor.
        However, (unfortunately) this does not work with ECMAScript classes. The reason is that Angular calls the constructor via
        fn.apply(), and ES6 prohibits (with an internal type error) an attempt to build a class without using <strong>new</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, even if you use annotation, you still need a factory function. The factory function itself can be simplified using new
        syntax available in ES6: <br /><br />
        <code>
            get $get() { return (...args) => new <em>constructorName</em>(...args); }
        </code> <br /><br />
        Since the constructor name varies per class, you would have to still add this function to each class.
    </p>
    <h4>Another Issue</h4>
    <p>
    The annotation loader builds the injection array, but we need the (callable) factory function appended to each injection array.
    You could add another line of code (per class) to do this.
    </p>

    <h3>The starter solution</h3>
    <p>
        To automate all that has been mentioned above, the starter app uses the annotation loader in conjunction with a <em>helper</em>
        that transforms the injection array into a form that will work with ES6 classes. You can find this helper in <code>/app/common.es6</code>
