    <h1>Models</h1>

    <p>
        A model with ECMAScript 6 is represented as a class.
        Without ES6 (and webpack), when you define a model you are forced to either put it into the global space,
        or turn it into an Angular service recipe so that it can be injected.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that in this starter app, models are defined in separate files, and used via an <code>import.</code>
        See the <code>/app/main/routingItem.model</code> as an example.
        (It is referenced by <code>/app/main/routing.provider.es6)</code>
