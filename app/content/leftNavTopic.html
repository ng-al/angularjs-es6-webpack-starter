    <h1>LeftNav</h1>

    <p>
        <code>/app/leftNav/leftNav.feature.es6</code> is the "main" file for the left navigation feature.
        By importing this file, the feature will be set up. This file performs the following tasks:
        <ol>
            <li>Imports the stylesheet for the feature.</li>
            <li>Imports the leftNav module. (This creates it.)</li>
            <li>Imports the leftNav component (directive).</li>
            <li>Registers the leftNav component with the leftNav module.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>/app/leftNav/leftNav.component.es6</code> is the leftNav Angular directive. It is written in <em>component-style</em>,
        which simply means that the directive uses a separate template and controller.
        The component's file has a controller class defined at the top, and the directive class at the bottom.
        (The template is in a separate file <code>/app/leftNav/leftNav.html</code> and is included by the <code>require</code>
        statement on line 46.
    </p>

    <h3>The LeftNav Directive</h3>
    <p>
        Note that the "normal" directive API properties are defined as properties of the class instance.
        The link function (not used in this example), is similarly defined.
        The controller is associated with the directive on line 41 and 42.  If you examine the template, you will see that all of
        the view model properties (defined by the controller), are referenced in the template with the prefix <em>vm.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>this.scope = false</code><br />
        Since all of the work is performed in the controller, there is no need to create an isolated scope for the directive.
        Note that when you do not create a scope, the <code>scope</code> parameter in the link function is the parent element's scope.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>this.bindToController = {}</code><br />
        This creates an isolated scope for the controller.
        Note that any properties created in this object will be present in the controller as properties on the <code>$scope</code>
        object.
    </p>

    <h3>The LeftNav Controller</h3>
    <p>
        The routing service is used to get the array of routing items.
        This collection is added to the view model so that the template can perform an <code>ng-repeat</code> over the data.
    </p>
    <p>
        A watch is placed on <code>$location.path()</code> so that whenever the path changes, the <code>activeTabIndex</code>
        will be set.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>onTabClick()</code> is called whenever a user clicks one of the "pills."
